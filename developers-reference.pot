"Debian's quality is largely due to the <ulink "

"also a shared history of experience which goes beyond the Debian Policy, an "

"The rationale for using helper scripts in <filename>debian/rules</filename> "
"is that they let maintainers use and share common logic among many "
"packages.  Take for instance the question of installing menu entries: you "
"need to put the file into <filename>/usr/share/menu</filename> (or "
"<filename>/usr/lib/menu</filename> for executable binary menufiles, if this "
"is needed), and add commands to the maintainer scripts to register and "
"unregister the menu entries.  Since this is a very common thing for packages "
"to do, why should each maintainer rewrite all this on their own, sometimes "
"with bugs? Also, supposing the menu directory changed, every package would "
"have to be changed."

"<xref linkend=\"tools\"/> contains a couple of different helpers.  The most "
"common and best (in our opinion) helper system is <systemitem "
"role=\"package\">debhelper</systemitem>.  Previous helper systems, such as "
"<systemitem role=\"package\">debmake</systemitem>, were monolithic: you "
"couldn't pick and choose which part of the helper you found useful, but had "
"to use the helper to do everything.  <systemitem "
"role=\"package\">debhelper</systemitem>, however, is a number of separate "
"little <command>dh_*</command> programs.  For instance, "
"<command>dh_installman</command> installs and compresses man pages, "
"<command>dh_installmenu</command> installs menu files, and so on.  Thus, it "
"offers enough flexibility to be able to use the little helper scripts, where "
